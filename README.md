# CMPE283-1

1. This is an individual submission completed by myself only.
2. a. I have arch linux installed in dual boot configuration on my laptop. GCC and make were pre installed.
   b. I downloaded cmpe283-1.c and Makefile provided in canvas and filled up the datastructures for other instructions in the hw, by looking them up in sdm.
   c. I built the module by running make all
   d. I inserted the module by running sudo insmod cmpe283-1.ko
   e. I checked that proper output was generated by running dmesg.
   
3. Output
